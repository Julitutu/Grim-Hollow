		<description>
			  <p>Incense burns dimly, as muffled coughs echo through the musty room. Loved ones hold each other as a bedridden woman exhales for the last time, her scarred face bearing the mortifying lesions of the Weeping Pox. Her family sobs, too lost in their sorrow to notice how the smouldering embers radiate and shine. A woman with flowing robes and platinum hair approaches, radiant energy emitting from her folded, angelic wings. “Hold on for but a moment my child,” she whispers. “Mercy has been granted.”</p>
              <p>With a thunderous boom, the Seraph’s hammer collides with a skeletal abomination. Shards of bone scatter across the dilapidated chapel floor as the monster roars in pain. Gritting her teeth, the angelic figure proclaims, “By all that is holy, you will be vanquished!” Golden fire erupts from her hammer as she prepares for another strike.</p>
              <p>Seraphs are mortals who have transformed into Celestial representations of a virtue or ideal. Exalted by a higher power, Seraphs are selected by divine beings after long and patient observation, confirming that the mortal displays pure character. Seraphs are selected from noble martyrs, tireless crusaders, or other exemplary individuals who are prepared to become the physical manifestation of righteousness.</p>
              <h4>Becoming a Seraph</h4>
              <p>To be chosen by an Arch Seraph is to become a vessel for the principles they uphold. This is a charge not to be taken lightly, and those who display righteousness with the intention of becoming a Seraph are usually overlooked for this reason. When becoming a Seraph, consider why your character was chosen. Do you display hidden merit? Are you devoted to a cause they will value?</p>
              <h4>Transformation Features</h4>
              <p>A Seraph has the following transformation features:</p>
              <h5>Prerequisites</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Ability Scores:</b> Wisdom 13</li>
                <li><b>Roleplay:</b> You must have been exalted by an Arch Seraph, divine cosmic energies, or have some other plausible reason to have become a Seraph. Discuss with your GM how you can achieve this in-game.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
              <center><p><b>Transformation Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p></center>
              <h5>Level Milestones</h5>
              <p>The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Seraph:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Defeating a powerful force of darkness.</li>
                <li>Create a hallowed landmark for pilgrims.</li>
                <li>Establish a parish of worshipers who uphold your virtue.</li>
                <li>Establish a portal between the Material Plane and the Empyrium.</li>
                <li>Redeem a soul that was considered beyond redemption.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>You have become a Seraph of noted virtue and divinity. This has made you a target for all that is dark in the world. Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet commits an act of greater evil, such as murdering a helpless innocent, a small amount of darkness attaches itself to you, and you gain 1 corruption point (to a maximum of 5). Whether the act constitutes greater evil is determined by the GM. Whenever you make an attack roll against an evil creature, or make a saving throw against a spell or ability from an evil creature, subtract the number of corruption points you have from the roll. Whenever you complete a short or long rest, and have prayed for at least 1 hour, you can reduce the number of corruption points you have by 1.</p>
