        <requirements>[cha:13]</requirements>
        <description>
            <p>The soft strumming of a harp draws the children ever deeper into the dark wood. As they reach a moonlit clearing, they see a beautiful maid dressed in a gown of starlight. She turns her soft gaze upon them at the sounds of their gasps and calls to them, “Welcome, little ones, be not afraid. Step into the ring so we may dance and play.”</p>
            <p>An elfin man with pale blue skin leans his forehead against the dying tree. As he softly hums, the shriveled leaves turn green once again, and the ancient bow begins to straighten. The man lets out a sigh of relief, which momentarily chills the air.</p>
            <p>The fey are changeable beings of great power and even greater danger. No two fey are quite alike, but their tie to the natural world is universal. Mortals cannot comprehend the level of true freedom the faerie people feel. To know such freedom is to change entirely.</p>
            <h4>Becoming a Fey</h4>
            <p>Becoming a fey requires a direct connection to the faerie realms. Most creatures who become fey are forced to do so when they are stolen from the material realm as a child. These children, known as changelings, rapidly transform after only a few days trapped in the realm of faerie. A changeling’s transition is often painful or strange, for a child altered in this way does not have a say in what type of fey they ultimately become.</p>
            <p>A creature who voluntarily seeks to become a fey can strike a deal with an arch fey or beseech the court of one of the faerie queens. These pathways to transformation are as dangerous as the realms of faeries themselves, and it requires a quick wit and sharp awareness to get the best of the fey kind.</p>
            <h4>Transformation Features</h4>
            <p>A fey has the following transformation features:</p>
            <h5>Prerequisites</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Ability Scores:</b> Charisma 13</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Roleplay:</b> You must have sworn fealty to one of the fey courts, been raised in the realms as a changeling, or have some other plausible reason to have become a fey. Discuss with your GM how you can achieve this in the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <center>
                <p>
                    <b>Transformation Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>Level Milestones</h5>
            <p>The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Fey:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Striking a bargain with a greater fey</li>
                <li>Performing a great deed in the name of one of the faerie queens</li>
                <li>Establishing a new faerie ring or bridge to the fey realms</li>
                <li>Defeating a powerful agent from your rival court</li>
                <li>Earning a domain or title in the realm of faerie</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your Charisma score increases by 2 and your Dexterity score increases by 1. An ability score cannot be increased beyond 16 this way. You also become a fey in addition to any other creature types you are. Spells that affect humanoids still affect you. However, you’re immune to effects that only affect a creature of your new type of a specific CR.</p>
            <p>When you gain this ability, you must also choose which Fey court fuels your transformation. Choose one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>The Summer Court.</b> The summer court embodies the bounty and warmth of the growing season. The fey of summer tend towards joviality, fickleness, and vanity. Creatures of summer often hide their cruel intentions behind beautiful facades.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>The Winter Court.</b> The winter court embodies the stillness and darkness of the coldest season. The fey of winter tend to be serious, cruel, and reflective. Creatures of winter are often terrifying to behold but very direct about their intentions.</li>

            <p>Your connection to the fey courts has granted you tremendous power but also an esoteric fragility: you gain a weakness towards cold damage if you are in the summer court, or fire damage if you are in the winter court.</p>
            <p>If you were normally resistant to this damage type, it instead affects you normally. If you are normally immune to damage of that type, you are resistant instead. In addition, whenever you take damage of that type, your maximum hit points are reduced by an equal amount. When your maximum hit points are reduced by this effect, they return to normal after you finish a long rest.</p>
