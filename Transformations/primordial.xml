        <requirements>[con:13]</requirements>
        <description>
              <p>The city dwellers raise their eyes to a floating figure barely glimpsed through the smog-filled sky. Their cries ring out as the figure, wreathed in flame, clenches a fist, causing the earth to tremble violently. The crushing weight of water is the last sensation the people know, as their filthy streets are washed clean.</p>
              <p>The primordial throws her head back as she exhales a gout of flame. Her charred skin rapidly heals as she wades free of the molten lava, laughing all the way. Her companions look on in horror as she calls to them, “I have heard it. I heard the song of creation!”</p>
              <p>Primordials are born when a humanoid absorbs a spark of primordial chaos. The primordial forces are the purest building blocks of creation, and a fostered spark quickly grows to an all-consuming flame. Mastering the elements requires unlearning the limitations of mortality, a process that spurs rapid transformation.</p>
              <h4>Becoming a Primordial</h4>
              <p>There are several ways for a mortal to consume a primordial spark, but continuing to become an elemental takes concentrated effort. A mortal might be born with an elemental spark, gifted one, or they could gain one by consuming the power of an elemental. Once acquired, one must spend a great deal of time contemplating and understanding the spark to unlock its full potential. The process of attaining elemental mastery is dangerous. The slightest slip in control can cause devastation on a massive scale. Such facts are why isolated individuals like druids, monks, or rangers are most likely to see the transformation through to its end.</p>
              <h4>Transformation Features</h4>
              <p>A Primordial has the following transformation features:</p>
              <h5>Prerequisites</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Ability Scores:</b> Constitution 13</li>
                <li><b>Roleplay:</b> Either through ritual, defeating a greater Elemental being, or some other means, you must consume a Primordial Spark.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
              <center><p><b>Transformation Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p></center>
              <h5>Level Milestones</h5>
              <p>The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Primordial:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Defeat and absorb the power of a greater elemental</li>
                <li>Claim an elemental node</li>
                <li>Make an alliance with a being from one of the elemental planes</li>
                <li>Use your powers to defeat an encroaching civilization</li>
                <li>Free an imprisoned or indentured elemental creature</li>
              </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Lightning Strike.</b> You can make a special ranged attack targeting a creature within 60 feet. You are proficient with this attack, which uses your Constitution modifier.

On a failed save, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier, or half as much on a successful save. Increase the damage by 1d6 for each transformation level about 2.
                    You also gain temporary hit points equal to half this amount.</li>

            <p>Your new native plane attempts to pull you to it, laying claim to your form. Whenever you roll a natural 1 on a saving throw against a magical spell or ability, you take 1d6 force damage per two character levels in addition to any other damage or effects you would suffer, as your native plane attempts to unbind you from the Material Plane. For example, a 6th-level character would take 3d6 force damage. This damage ignores resistances and immunities.</p>
