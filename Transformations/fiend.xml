		<description>
			<p>A smirking, well-dressed man of unknown origin appears in a time of great need. He extends his hand and a contract manifests in a golden flash. With a quill floating by his side, he remarks, “Of course I can fix your dilemma. After all, who do you think caused it in the first place?” For a solution to a world of problems, the man asks for only two things in return: a signature and an eternity of servitude.</p>
			<p>Hellfire swirls up a Fiend’s arms as she laughs maniacally. In a single motion, she launches waves of fiery death at the legions of lesser Daemons sent to rein her in. Those who perish twist and harden into charred, blackened figures with bright molten cores. The Fiend laughs again as she snaps her fingers and each figure explodes into another wave of fiery destruction.</p>
			<p>Many tales are told in Etharis of the power of Fiends and the dangers of their contracts. Regardless, every year a champion rises, a prodigy is born, or some individual makes a deal for their soul in exchange for Lady Luck to be on their side. To a Fiend, a soul is a delicious meal with an invigorating aftertaste. Most importantly, a soul contains the power to sustain their transformation.</p>
			<h4>Becoming a Fiend</h4>
			<p>A mortal can become a Fiend in a variety of ways. Some forfeit their souls and become one upon death. Others undertake excruciating rituals to transform into one. However, your character becomes a Fiend constitutes their contract. Communicating with your GM about creating deals with mortals in their story is a great way to roleplay your influence within the game world. As a Fiend, you should consider what your character’s motivations are and which NPCs they can use to achieve their goals.</p>
			<h4>Transformation Features</h4>
			<p>A Fiend has the following transformation features:</p>
			<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
			<p><b>Ability Scores:</b> Charisma 13</p>
			<p><b>Roleplay:</b> You must have made a pact with a Fiend, undergone an infernal ritual, or have some other plausible reason to have become a Fiend. Discuss with your GM how you can achieve this in-game.</p>
            <p>Some of your abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist their effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Transformation Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
            </center>
			<h5>Level Milestones</h5>
            <p>The following are examples of possible level milestones for the Fiend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defeating a greater rival Fiend and taking their place in the hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Ensnaring a particularly powerful or influential soul with a contract.</li>
                <li>Establishing a cult of worshipers who offer their strength to you.</li>
                <li>Establishing a portal between the material plane and the Netherworld.</li>
                <li>Killing or corrupting a Seraph.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You have acquired the ability to bind your first mortal to your will. You can create a contract to bind their soul to you, feeding on its power. However, you will not gain the benefits of this gift until you have bound a mortal with a contract.</p>
            <p>To bind a mortal’s soul to you and grant them a Gift of Damnation, you must first create a contract for that gift. A contract requires magical ink and paper worth 50gp for each Transformation level you have acquired, and you must meet the prerequisites listed. In addition, you and the mortal must both sign the contract willingly, fully aware of the costs involved. Once signed, Netherworld entities give the benefits of the gift to you, and the mortal receives the named benefit within 7 days. You do not have to provide this benefit yourself. For example, upon signing a contract for a Gift of Unfettered Glory, you will receive the benefits listed under the gift. The mortal who signs will receive glory and no in-game mechanical bonuses, provided by the dubious powers of the Netherworld.</p>
            <p>While you may have any number of contracts in your possession, you can only benefit from one at a time. Upon the completion of a long rest, you may swap the contract you are currently benefiting from for an alternate contract that you have bound a mortal to and signed.</p>
            <p>On your turn, as an action, you can call upon the Netherworld to reveal to you the exact location of a creature that has signed one of your contracts, providing they are on the same plane of existence as you.</p>
            <p>A contract you hold lasts for 7 years or until the mortal that signed it dies. At which point it bursts into flames and you cannot receive any benefits from it.</p>
