            <p>You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into wood. If the
                target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw.
                On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden into bark. On a
                successful save, the creature isn’t affected.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution
                saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this
                spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its Constitution saving throw three
                times, it is turned into a tree and subjected to the petrified condition for the
                duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of
                both until the target collects three of a kind.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the transformed creature is burned, chopped down, or otherwise
                destroyed while petrified, the creature is slain. A creature remains transformed
                unless the effect is reversed within one year with remove curse, wish, or similar
                magical effects. If the creature spends one year and a day as a tree, the
                transformation becomes permanent, and nothing can return the creature to its
                original form.</p>

                creature, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A

            <p>A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between you and the
                caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a creature of your choice
                that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is 5th level or lower, you are no
                longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. If the spell is 6th
                level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC
                equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, you are no longer a target of
                the spell and the chosen creature is instead. On a failed check, you remain the
                target of the triggering spell.</p>

            <p>You create a wall of swirling grey energy, formed of the psychic pain of forlorn
                loss. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration.
                You choose to make them all up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a
                circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick—the
                wall blocks line of sight.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall radiates dim light out to a range of 100 feet. You and
                creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain
                near the wall without harm. If another creatur moves to within 20 feet of it or
                starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or
                become incapacitated for one round as they are overcome with a flood of negative
                feelings.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature can move through the wall, though the attempt is
                emotionally draining. The first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends
                its turn there, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw, taking one level of
                exhaustion on a failed save.</p>

			<p>You channel the powers of the Primordials to animate a number of plants within range. These plants must be in an open and unoccupied space. If no space is available, then the GM may choose to have plants rapidly grow as a result of the spell. In this case the GM also chooses how many plants grow. Choose one of the following options for what appears:</p>
            <ul>
				<li>One plant of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
				<li>Two plants of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
				<li>Four plants of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
				<li>Eight plants of challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
			</ul>
            <p class="indent">Each plant is considered an elemental in addition to its other types, and it becomes a normal plant again when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The animated creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the animated creatures as a group, which has its own turns. The creatures obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you).</p>
            <p class="indent">If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures but otherwise take no actions. The GM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the animating options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.</p>

			<p>This spell may only be cast at night. Choose a corpse, or a number of corpses, within range that are equivalent the size of the creatures you are animating (the GM will determine how many corpses are required).  You can animate a number of large or smaller undead creatures equalling a total challenge rating 2 or lower.</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which time it stops obeying any command you’ve given it.</p>
            <p class="indent">To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over 1 creature you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one. Additionally, casting this spell in this manner does not require spell components with a GP cost.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control of an additional CR worth of undead creatures created with this spell. When you cast this spell using a 9th level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over an additional two CR worth of undead creatures created with this spell. Additional creatures must be animated with sufficient corpses or bones.</p>

			<p>You create an illusory copy of a mundane musical instrument.

This illusory instrument dissipates if the spellcaster moves 10 feet away from it or chooses to end the spell. As a bonus action, you can command your instrument to create one of the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mimic basic sounds heard on a daily basis, such as a bird chirping, footsteps, or a slamming door.</li>

			<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a sickly green ethereal tether forms between you and your target. Whenever you take damage, each tethered target takes half that amount as necrotic damage. Damage dealt this way is distributed after any damage resistances or immunities are applied. If a target with a tether drops to 0 Hit Points, they are no longer affected by the tether. As a bonus action, you can move the tether from one fallen foe to another target. The new target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or also be subject to the effects of this spell. A target may only have one tether attached to them from any instance of this spell at a given time.</p>

			<p>A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between you and the caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is 2nd level or lower, then the spell is automatically copied. Copying a spell of 3rd level or higher requires a successful ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the spell is copied, and you cast that spell at the lowest level it can be cast. You can only copy spells of a lesser or equal level to the spell slot used to cast Mirror Spell. You can choose new targets for the copied spell. The following rules apply:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>You cannot copy your own spell.</li>
            <li>You can only copy spells cast by creatures.</li>
