        <description>
            <p>BACKGROUNDS ARE EXCELLENT storytelling tools when it comes to identifying who your
                character is and where they come from. A gallant soldier may have a dark past as a
                mercenary sellsword or a gang enforcer. Advanced backgrounds provide an additional
                layer to this process. They seek to identify where a character comes from, and
                highlight where they may progress to, within the world setting.</p>
            <p class="indent">Advanced Backgrounds are a variant option for the background system.
                It is suggested that either all characters within a party use Advanced Backgrounds,
                or none. To use Advanced Backgrounds, select a background and choose a profession
                within that background. If you feel that no backgrounds or professions suit your
                character concept, then discuss with your GM how you can modify one to fit your
                needs</p>
            <h5>Professions</h5>
            <p>Professions best represent what your character does between adventures, whether it’s
                a job to make money, or a title or responsibility they must uphold. Each background
                has multiple professions, and describes that profession’s place in the world. For
                example, your character may be a Seafarer, but what do they do at sea? They may be a
                pauper, scavenging whatever they can find of value from the ocean shores. In this
                case, you may choose the Seagather. There are no wrong choices.</p>
            <h5>Profession Abilities</h5>
            <p>Once you have selected your profession, you gain access to its Profession Ability.
                This is an activity that you have practiced time and time again, becoming an expert
                in this field. Each profession ability requires an hour spent completing the task,
                and a Medium DC skill check. Once you have attempted a profession ability, you
                cannot attempt it again until you complete a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Profession Dice</h5>
            <p>Profession Dice are the in-game advantages provided to characters by their background
                profession. Characters can add their Profession Die to skill or ability checks
                according to any Talents they have selected.</p>
            <p>In addition, a character always adds their Profession Die when rolling for Profession
                Abilities.</p>
            <p>A character’s Profession Die is determined bytheir rank, and shown in the table
                below:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="col-10">Profession Rank</td>
                        <td>Profession Dice</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>1d4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>1d6</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>1d8</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>1d10</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h5>Skill Check Difficulties</h5>
            <p>When a player is required to make a skill check, the DC is determined by the GM using
                the following table:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="col-10">Difficulty</td>
                        <td>DC</td>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>Easy</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Medium</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hard</td>
                    <td>20</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Very Hard</td>
                    <td>25</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Impossible</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>When determining DC, a GM may start with the complexity of the task, then adjust it
                based on environmental factors. For example, a character may be trying to climb a
                ladder, a task which would normally not require a skill check.</p>
            <p>However, the weather is chilly, and the ladder is slick with ice, so the GM decides
                to set a Medium DC. This DC might be increased again for further complicating
                factors, such as pursuing enemies or if the ladder is broken</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> It is important to remember that rolling a natural 20 on a skill check
                does not result in an automatic success.</p>
            <h5>Proficiencies &amp; Equipment</h5>
            <p>When creating a character, Advanced Backgrounds add skill proficiencies and starting
                equipment in a similar way to backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Once you have selected your background and profession, you may select a skill
                proficiency, per your background’s selection list. Once you’ve made your choices,
                apply your starting equipment and proficiency from your background and profession.</p>
            <h5>Rankings, Holdings, and Progressions</h5>
            <p>Rankings represent a character’s standing within the world of their profession. Each
                profession has four ranks, with characters starting at the first rank. Whenever a
                character meets the progression milestones of a rank within their profession (as
                discussed with the GM), they may progress to the next rank of that profession.</p>
            <p>A Captain and his daring crew or a Duke and his extravagant estate are both examples
                of a profession’s holdings. Within Advanced Backgrounds, holdings are the assets,
                resources, or advantages a character gains through their position. Holdings vary
                between professions, from finding free lodging to acquiring a grand fortress and
                legions of soldiers, or anything in between. Within each profession are examples of
                the sorts of holdings a character might achieve as they progress through the
                professional ranks. Whenever a character advances in rank, they retain their
                holdings from previous ranks.</p>
            <p>Progressions are examples of what may be required for you to advance in rank within
                your profession. From making a medical breakthrough to being appointed by a monarch,
                progressions vary depending on the rank and profession they belong to. Progressions
                make great character goals and can be tied into existing character or party goals.
                For example, a scribe looking to disprove falsehoods could do so by pursuing the
                mystery at the heart of the campaign’s overall story.</p>
            <p>Progressions and holdings within this chapter are recommendations only. Ultimately it
                is up to the GM to determine how the characters within your setting progress, and
                what holdings are necessary to the gameplay. Additionally, a GM may decide to allow
                a character to progress within their profession due to alternative reasons, such as
                circumstantial gameplay, setting requirements, or for any other reason. Players and
                GMs should discuss what sort of holdings a player could expect to receive at each
                rank and what progression paths may be available to them.</p>
            <h5>Talents</h5>
            <p>Talents are unique dispositions, experiences, or characteristics your character has
                picked up due to their time working in their profession. This is represented by
                allowing characters to add their Profession Die in unique situations that highlight
                the skills gained through their profession. A character may select a Talent from
                their corresponding Talent list when they select their profession, and select an
                additional Talent whenever they rank up within a profession.</p>
            <h5>Changing Profession</h5>
            <p>Plans never play out as expected, and sometimes professions don’t either. A character
                may change professions by achieving the progression requirements of the profession
                rank they wish to change to. When they achieve these requirements they may rank up
                into the new rank of that profession, choosing a Talent from their new profession
                list. A character that has ranked up into another profession retains all equipment,
                Talents, proficiencies, and abilities from their original profession. After all, you
                can change your future, but not your past.</p>
            <p>For example, Aylea is a Militarist Field Marshal. A recent brush with a dark sorcerer
                has confirmed her faith in her deity, and now she wishes to become an Inquisitor.
                Aylea’s player discusses with their GM what sort of holdings and progression
                milestones Aylea must achieve to rank into Inquisitor. Due to her seasoned military
                experience, the GM decides that once contact has been made with a Chapter Master,
                Aylea will become an Inquisitor at the rank of Initiate, a rank from which Aylea is
                likely to advance quickly.</p>

            <p>Any structured society has those who fall through the cracks. Misfortune is no
                stranger to Etharis, and those who suffer under its hand have to make do any way
                they can. Some attempt to survive by begging or turning their hands to whatever jobs

            <p>Those paupers who choose to leave their past behind and take to the open road are
                known as vagabonds. Some do so in an attempt to flee whatever painful memories
                caused their descent into poverty, while others hold out hope of starting a new life
                in another city. Most don’t survive outside the protective walls of a guarded
                settlement, but those that do often find little welcome in the cities they visit.
                Vagabonds must therefore work hard to gain trust and forge what connections they may
                have in each place they visit, and invariably they must move on before they wear out

            <p>The major kingdoms of Etharis are far from the only bastions of culture to stand
                against the current darkness. From the frozen north to the Gulf of Lions, numerous
                tribes have chosen to keep to their traditional lifestyle, living in harmony with
                the spirits of the wild. Where hunting and gathering aren’t sufficient to support
                their population, many have turned to raiding the more “civilized” regions. This has
                garnered the tribes a reputation as barbarians and savages, but this ignores a rich
                history and a deep, abiding respect for nature.</p>
            <p>Clan members are generally more at home traveling through the wilds than their urban
                counterparts. Their close ties with nature and the spirits of the wild also gives
                them a unique perspective on many problems, and they are less quick to condemn
                things they are unfamiliar with. Those that leave the tribe often make good guides,
                trackers, and mercenaries.</p>

                Courtiers represent the members of the aristocracy who are employed or invited by a

                schemers and manipulators than helpful assistants. The life of a Courtier is one of
                dangerous plots, uneasy political alliances, and the occasional act of betrayal –

            <p>Envoys are the representatives of their governments or monarchs to others abroad.
                Often sent into faraway parts of the world, their responsibility is to forge new
                alliances, and maintain existing ones. However, much of an Envoy’s tasks are
                reactive – responding to a noble’s threats, securing defensive pacts in times of
                conflict, or bolstering border defences. Envoys go where there is conflict.</p>

            <p>Priests lead the common people in the teachings of their deities. They are the
                figureheads and leaders in the temples and shrines where they preach, providing

                considerable influence within their communities, and are treated with reverence

                they occupy themselves, common folk are typically identified by the work they do.
                Often finding themselves pawns in the machinations of those who consider themselves
                their betters, commoners generally look after one another in tight circles of trust.
                Commoners are a great background for most professions and character concepts that do

                to the depth of human emotion in portraying sadness, love, or joy. Their music
                likewise enlivens or stirs sorrow. Their dance steps are nimble and cheering, and

            <p>Hunters make their living by trapping, hunting, and killing vicious beasts. Some
                provide meat and furs for settlements, or for trade. The strongest may become a
                community’s best defense against wandering monsters.. They are often as brutish as
                the creatures they hunt, heavily scarred from close encounters with their prey. They
                are proficient in setting many different traps, from simple snares to spring-loaded
                traps and cages. The beast hunter typically favors ranged weapons when taking down
                larger prey, avoiding close range where possible. Some favor stealth, lying
                patiently in ambush, while others revel in the thrill of the chase. Beast hunters
                have a natural aptitude for tracking all manner of beasts, quickly noticing signs
                that an animal has passed by, down to an exact time and direction of travel.</p>
