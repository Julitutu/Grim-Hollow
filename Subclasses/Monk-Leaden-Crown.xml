			<p>In contrast to the esoteric ideals of other monastic traditions, monks of the Way of the Leaden Crown have practical aims: the self-governance of humanoid peoples. These monks see the history of the world as a series of clashes between groups of powerful beings, where humanoids were at best collateral damage and at worst disposable pawns. To break this cycle of dependence and destruction, monks of the Way of the Leaden Crown master mental powers to fight back against the otherworldly powers of the multiverse and protect humanoid sovereignty.</p>
			<p class="indent">One component of this plan involves training to do battle with powerful outsiders. The other equally important component is ensuring that humanoid societies are prepared to overthrow those powerful outsiders already dominating them. To that end, these monks seek political positions that place them in or near decision-making roles where they can influence humanoids to fight back against arch seraphs, arch daemons, and primordials.</p>

            <p>Starting at 11th level, each time you hit a creature with an unarmed strike it gains a pressure point. A creature loses all pressure points if you give a different creature a pressure point or 1 minute after the last time it gained a pressure point. As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki points to telekinetically crush a creature with 1 or more of your pressure points.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you do, the creature must make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failure, the creature takes 1d8 force damage per pressure point they have and they are restrained until the end of your next turn.
