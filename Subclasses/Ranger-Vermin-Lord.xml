			<p>Vermin Lords cultivate loyal hordes of disease-bearing rodents to help them in their efforts to stem a greater evil. For many of these rangers, that greater evil is some kind of societal ill, but a rare few see their fellow humanoids as an infestation that threatens the natural world. Regardless of their goal, they make their homes in sewers, slums, and other forgotten places, where they are free to plot against their enemies and tend to their vermin kin.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with vermin (mice, rats, and other rodents determined by your DM).</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can use an action and expend a spell slot to summon rodent hordes. When you do, you summon a number of swarms of vermin equal to twice the level of spell slot expended. Each swarm is summoned to a space you can see within 30 feet. Swarms summoned in this way go on your initiative, starting on your next turn. These swarms obey your verbal commands (no action required by you), defending themselves by taking the Dodge action if you do not give them a command. Your vermin swarms flee the area and disperse after 10 minutes or when you use this feature to summon other swarms of vermin.</p>
