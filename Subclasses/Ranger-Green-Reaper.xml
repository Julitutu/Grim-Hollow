			<p>Green Reapers specialize in a school of assassination that specializes in harvesting and catalyzing the toxic elements of flora and fauna. These rangers often work as killers for hire utilizing their extensive knowledge of toxins to end their marks’ lives discreetly or with gory panache, depending on the poison used and the client’s wishes. Green Reapers exhibit a morbid curiosity when encountering a toxic substance they’re unfamiliar with, typically followed by an enthusiastic application of the toxin on the next foe they encounter.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Green Reaper Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you can use your poisoner’s kit as a bonus action to coat a weapon or up to twenty pieces of ammunition with a dose of toxic poison.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and expended uses of this feature are recovered at the end of a long rest.</p>

            <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses this proficiency. Additionally, when you gain this feature, you also gain a poisoner’s kit.

            <p class="indent">As a final benefit of this feature, once per turn when you hit a creature with a weapon or ammunition enhanced by your Envenomed Attack feature, you can spend a spell slot to apply a magical toxin to the attack. The toxin deals an additional 1d6 poison damage and the creature is poisoned until the end of your next turn. The toxin has additional effects based on the spell slot expended casting the spell:</p>
            <p><strong>1st-Level Effects</strong></p>
            <p>When you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Attenuate.</b>While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
                <li><b>Befuddled.</b>While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it cannot speak, read, or write any language and it has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells.</li>
                <li><b>Uncoordinated.</b>While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it cannot take reactions or the Disengage or Dodge action.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>2nd-Level Effects</strong></p>
            <p>When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Debilitate.</b>The creature can’t regain hit points for the next minute.</li>
                <li><b>Potent.</b>If the creature has resistance to poison damage, it loses that resistance for the next minute.</li>
                <li><b>Suffer.</b>For the next minute, the first time the creature takes poison damage each turn it takes an additional 1d6 poison damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>3rd-Level Effects</strong></p>
            <p>When you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Lingering.</b>Instead of ending at the end of your next turn, the creature continues to be poisoned for 10 minutes. At the end of each of the creature’s turns it can make a Constitution saving throw using your ranger spell save DC. If the creature accumulates three successes, which do not have to be consecutive, the poisoned condition ends early.</li>
                <li><b>Supernatural.</b>When you deal damage with a weapon attack that has been dosed with this toxin, the creature loses immunity to the poisoned condition if it has such an immunity. In addition, instead of ending at the end of your next turn, the creature continues to be poisoned for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature’s turns it can make a Constitution saving throw using your ranger spell save DC, ending the condition on a success.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>4th-Level Effects</strong></p>
            <p>When you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Flesh Eating.</b>While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.</li>
                <li><b>Insensate.</b>While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, it is also blinded and deafened.</li>
                <li><b>Paraplegia.</b>While a creature is poisoned by this toxin, its movement speeds become 0 and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5th-Level Effects</strong></p>
            <p>When you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to create a toxin, choose one of the following effects to add to the toxin.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Enhanced.</b>Choose an additional option for this toxin off of the 4th level effects list and another additional option off of the 1st or 2nd level effects list.</li>
                <li><b>Stinging Application.</b>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack that used this toxin, the attack deals an additional 5d6 damage. This additional damage’s type is your choice of acid, necrotic, or poison.</li>
