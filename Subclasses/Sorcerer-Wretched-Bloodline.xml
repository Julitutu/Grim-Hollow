			<p>With every promise made to a fairy, contract signed with a devil, and pact with the unquiet dead, there’s a chance someone doesn’t keep their end of the bargain. The vengeance of immortal beings lasts much longer than one lifetime, and the lingering magic of these curses can affect the mortal’s descendants.</p>
            <p class="indent">These inherited magical afflictions may manifest as a plague, deformity, or aversion to the sun. In such families, a child may be born that learns to master the latent magic within their inherited curse, turning their bloodline’s bane into a personal boon—these sorcerers are known collectively as the Wretched.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you have mastered the ability to temporarily cast a small fragment of your curse onto another. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature has disadvantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point to use it again.</p>

            <h5 class="caption">HULKING</h5>
			<p>Your ancestor was cursed with a hulking frame. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks made to move quietly. In addition, your maximum hit points increase by 1 and increase by 1 again each time you gain a level in this class. Finally, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">NOCTURNAL</h5>
			<p>Your ancestor was cursed to shun the light of day. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) ability checks made to see while you are in sunlight. In addition, you have darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet and can see through magical darkness within that range.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">PLAGUEBEARER</h5>
			<p>Your ancestor was cursed with physical symptoms of a plague. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) ability checks made against humanoid creatures who are not blinded. In addition, you are immune to disease and have resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
